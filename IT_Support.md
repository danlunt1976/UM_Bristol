# IT Support

These pages include a list of ongoing IT support work associated with the BRIDGE machines.

# Requesting Support
All requests for support should go through one of three routes:
(1) For faults (e.g. can't log in, something that used to work is no longer working), use the [IT self-service pages](https://uob.haloitsm.com/portal/) and click on "Report a Fault".  Start your request with the "standard heading" text below. 
(2) For requests for relatively small to medium scale jobs, e.g. installing new software on the BRIDGE machines, use the [IT self-service pages](https://uob.haloitsm.com/portal/) and click on "Request something" and then "Advice and Information".  Start your request with the "standard heading" text below. 
(3) For longer term requests that involve significant amounts of time (e.g. purchasing a new machine, reconfiguring operating systems), please discuss this with your PI.  They can then make a request via the [Strategic Evaluation Tool  SET](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-strategic-evaluation) 

### Standard heading for requests via IT services
