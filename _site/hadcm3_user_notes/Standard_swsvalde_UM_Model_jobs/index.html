<h1 id="1-tcsy---hadcm3b-m1---hadcm3b-with-moses1">1) tcsy - HadCM3B-M1 - HadCM3B with MOSES1</h1>

<p>This job has its original origins from the original release of the PUM, starting around the year 2000. This was modified for running on standard MPP machines but should otherwise be scientifically identical to the original HadCM3-M1 as published in Pope et al and Gordon et al. Over the subsequent 9 years, the core science remained unchanged but a standard structure and naming convention was developed so that it was easy to submit to a range of different machines without the need to make changes within the umui.</p>

<p>In 2009, related to problems with the MOSES2.1 (see later), it was realised that we needed to create standard versions of all model setups. We also needed to benchmark standard versions.</p>

      <td>This created some significant changes to model. The pstar and ocean smoothing updates did as expected i.e. they removed two grid waves without further serious changes. The gwave update made no difference. This was because the pre-industrial variances were OK. The bottom friction only changed the deep ocean and the circumpolar current. The latter improved it compared to ocean reanalysis. Almost no change to surface temp/precip.<br /><br />These changes are going to be documented in Valdes et al 2024.</td>

<p>The origin of this job is the PMIP2 project in around 2004. Michel Crucifix, then working at the Hadley Centre, created a HadCM3 version of the Cox et al (2000) HadCM3LC model. This version includes the bug fix related to the wrong surface energy balance that existed in the original Cox et al simulations. HOWEVER, at that time we had a significant problem. When we ran this job on our HPC computers, it gave different answers (0.75C different in the global mean). We could not locate the problem and for several years  had to have a MetOffice version and a Bristol version.</p>

<p>Eventually, Lois Steenman-Clarke at CGAM, Reading located the problem. It was a problem related to a data statement in a subroutine and an ambiguity of FORTRAN (does the data statement reset the constant every time the subroutine is called). Different FORTRAN compilers implemented this differently. At this point, we were then able to create a “true” standard version and benchmark it against a previous simulation. This became the starting point of the model.</p>

<p>There was also an issue with a pre-STASH modification (mosesii) we included in our version, which was actually meant for MOSES2.2, not 2.1, and removing this resulted in a good agreement between the Bristol and Met Office versions.  See <a href="https://www.paleo.bristol.ac.uk/wiki/bridge/Computing/MOSES">these notes on our old wiki</a>.</p>

<h1 id="4-tfff---hadam3b-n216-moses1">4) tfff - HadAM3B-N216-MOSES1</h1>

<p>This is a relatively new configuration, first developed in 2021. It was developed from a standard HPCX setup job created by CGAM (xbafd). xbafd was developed from a version from the UK MetOffice. N216 was the standard forecasting-mode type job around 2000, and which was extensively used for storm case studies by CGAM/Uni Reading.</p>

<p>xbafd had a lot of old physics (e.g. single level soil scheme, different radiation etc.) which I did not want to reproduce. Indeed the philosophy was not to match the existing configuration of any high resolution version of the model but to focus on producing a high resolution version of HadAM3B which was as close as possible to the physics of the lower resolution model. Hence, the choices of physics parameterisations and corresponding modsets were driven by maintaining compatibility to HadAM3B. The only changes were for parameters that were known to be resolution dependent. This includes the RHCRIT parameters, diffusion, a known resolution dependence to the soil water infiltration code, land/sea precip parameters, gravity wave drag.</p>

<p>These were tuned to produce the best possible surface temperature and precipitation simulation. However, it was surprisingly difficult to get both right so a compromise had to be made.</p>
