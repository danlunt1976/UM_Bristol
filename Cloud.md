# Cloud Services

These are instructions for how to set up the VPS (virtual private server) for [https://data.deepmip.org](https://data.deepmip.org) , but will be useful to anyone setting up cloud services.

(1) In order to pay for cloud services with corporate credit card, need this category (0005 - telecommunications services, or maybe 4816) to be unlocked on the card.  Contact corporate-cloud mailbox, and IT services.  

(2) Need to have a cloud provider.  We will rent a VPS (virtual private server).  Seb uses ovhcloud. Another option is microsoft azure.  [https://ovcloud.com](https://ovhcloud.com) .  Go to "Bare Metal and VPS / VPS / Configure your VPS".  I went for VPS-1 (8GB RAM (smallest size available, sufficient for data.deepmip.org), and Ubuntu (same as Seb).  12 months.  France (Gravelines).  Â£48.96.  Made an ovh account.

(3) not done this bit yet....
nginx web server.  runs a docker.  container.  configure sslx access.  can restart server.  data.deepmip.org.

(4) N.B. - the DeepMIP database is still live, and on the ESGF.
