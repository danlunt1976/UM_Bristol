This is a summary of the current state of our BRIDGE machines

Array disk size from: `df -BG`
OS from: `rpm -qa centos-release` or `rpm -qa rocky-release`

We need to comply with CyberEssentials+.  Deadline end-March 2025.  Requires update from Centos 6.10 to Rocky8.  But not for silurian or anthropocene as they are out of scope at present.  Eocene and Oligocene physically moved to an out of scope location to avoid this requirement for now.

Rocky8 now on miocene.  But not tested.  gfortran does not compile all the scripts.  Intel compiler is fine though.  qplot does not compile.

Plan - open miocene up to group.  When working, send to group and ask for feedback.

BluePebble is possibly the future of local hardware.  Could have a head-node plus a disk.  However, Digital Labs may be replacing Bluepebble.  See [University_HPC](University_HPC)

Fund machines via Capital Bids?

Issue is that the UID for swsvalde has been used elsewhere in the university.  Maybe also the paleo group ID.  (Conflicts exist because the old UIDs/GIDs were allocated locally via NIS, rather than using the central identity management)
