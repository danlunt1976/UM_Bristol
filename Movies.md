Movie pages are for listing ensembles of simulations on the webpages, e.g. the Scotese simulations.  An example is [here](https://www.paleo.bristol.ac.uk/ummodel/scripts/html_bridge/scotese_02.html) A list of all movies is [here](https://www.paleo.bristol.ac.uk/ummodel/users/ggdjl/new2/movie.html) (get here via "Movies of a sequence of simulations" under Analyse_Pages)

To make a movie page, create a .dat file on eocene here, by analogy with the existing files: /home/bridge/swsvalde/ummodel/scripts/html_list/movies .  

The movie pages will be created automatically overnight with a crontab on oligocene as part of the daily website rebuild.  See scripts make_html_movies and make_movies_html in /home/bridge/swsvalde/ummodel/scripts .
