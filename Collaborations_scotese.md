# Collaborations with Scotese simulations


The purpose of this file is to document collaborations associated with BRIDGE simulations, in particular the “Scotese” simulations carried out by Dan (and earlier simulations by Paul).

Usually we are very happy to share simulations, but would require that we (The person who carried out the simulation, the project PI, and the Bristol person who is the primary contact) are included as co-authors in at least the first paper they publish that uses the simulations, and are included in the scientific discussions.


# Information on the simulations

[See this document for details of the simulations and naming convention of the Scotese simulations](Accessing_scotese.md)

**Alex’s Getech simulations:**  
tfgs = Getech paleogeogs (to 300 Ma), but with CO2 from tfke.  Same physics as tfke.  10 Cretaceous stages currently missing.
