# Editing Guide

## Introduction

Our aim is to generate documentation that is useful, and remains useful in the future.  As such, it 
needs to be in a format which (a) all users can easily contribute to, and (b) is future-proof.

We have decided to use a combination of 'markdown' (the file format) and 'github' (the version control system).  This combination is standard for large code documentation.  

Markdown files are raw ascii text files, with some very basic formatting.  The idea is that it is easy to write, updates/changes are easily viewable, and should be relatively future-proof.  Here is a guide to some basic markdown syntax: [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/ "https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/") . 

Github is a version control system which is very popular for maintaining code and documentation.  You can read more about github [here](https://github.com/about).    

## Reading the documentation

The documentation files are automatically pushed to a webpage, which is here:
[https://danlunt1976.github.io/UM_Bristol](https://danlunt1976.github.io/UM_Bristol "https://danlunt1976.github.io/UM_Bristol")

You can also read the pages directly on github, here: https://github.com/danlunt1976/UM_Bristol . Start by clicking on the "README.md" file, which is the entry point: https://github.com/danlunt1976/UM_Bristol/blob/main/README.md


## Writing the documentation

The documentation will be most useful if everyone can contribute to writing and maintaining it.  

In order to contribute, you will need an account on github. Apply here for a (currently!) free account:  https://github.com/signup .  Once you have an account on github (see above), email Dan Lunt (d.j.lunt@bristol.ac.uk) with your github username, and he will invite you to be a collaborator.  You will then have edit-rights. 

### Easiest entry-point for writing documentation

(1) Once logged into your github account, go to the web interface for the documentation repository:
https://github.com/danlunt1976/UM_Bristol 

(2) Click on one of the .md files

(3) Click on the pencil icon above the file text ('Edit this file').

(4) Make some edits.

(5) Click on the green button "Commit changes..."

(6) Write a "Commit message" in the upper box, and leaving "Commit directly to the main branch" selected.

(7) Click on "Commit changes"

(8) Have a beer.


### More advanced writing (from a Windows machine)

Instead of editing the wiki directly as above, you can download a 'clone' of the repository to your local machine, and edit it there, and then 'push' back to the main repository.  Before 'pushing' you should 'pull' form the main repository, to ensure that you do not overwrite or clash with anyone else's changes.  You can do this pushing and pulling using the 'Github Desktop' app.  The main benefit of editing locally is that you can take advantage of some nice tools for writing and viewing markdown files and sites.  One such editing tool is 'Obsidian'.  Here are some instructions:

(1) Download the 'GitHub Desktop' app for Windows: https://desktop.github.com/download/

(2) Clone a copy of the repository, following these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop .  You can choose anywhere on your local filesystem to hold your local copy.

(3) You can edit the .md files in your local copy using whatever editing sofware you wish (e.g. Wordpad).  However, to have access to some useful tools, you can use a specific markdown file editor.  One example is Obsidian.  Download it to your desktop here:  https://obsidian.md/download .   Open Obsidian and click on 'Open folder as vault'.  It should then be fairly intuitive how to edit files.

(4) Once you have finished editing, re-open GitHub Desktop.  Click on 'Fetch origin' to 'pull' any changes that anyone else has made.  Then write a comment in the 'Summary' box, and then click on 'Commit to main'

(5) Click on 'Push origin'

(6) Have another beer.

### From a MAC

I'm sure it's possible, but I have no idea how.


### From a Linux machine.

Also definitely possible.  I have local repositories on eocene that Greg set up, for my code repositories.  I (Dan) have some notes on this if anyone is interested (and then you can update these instructions!).
