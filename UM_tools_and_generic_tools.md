# Documentation for useful tools
# Introduction

When interacting with models and model results, some tools are useful for visualising (e.g., xconv, panoply), some tools are useful for files downloading (e.g., ftp_master), and some tools are useful for configuration data (ancillary files) manipulation (e.g., xancil, isla). We provide an overview of essential tools for common modeling work.

## xconv

https://ncas-cms.github.io/xconv-doc
Xconv is a program designed to convert model output into a format suitable for use in various plotting packages. Xconv is designed to be simple to use with a point and click, windows based interface. Xconv can read Met. Office Unified Model, Met. Office PP, GRIB, netCDF and grads format data. Data can be output in netCDF and grads format.

## xancil

https://ncas-cms.github.io/xancil-doc/singlehtml/index.html
Xancil is a X-windows based application for creating Unified Model ancillary files from netCDF input files.

## panoply
