[Back to HadCM3 for CMIP7](HadCM3_CMIP7.md)

Here we give a brief summary of our experiments. We plan to have several phases of experiments.
1. Single testing phase, where the primary goal is to test the functionality of our models (to resolve different forcings) to participate in CMIP7. And as several of us are responsible for a specified forcing, we will document them in different categories.
2. Combined testing phase, where various forcings are configured together to make sure the models are working fine.
3. CMIP7 experiments phase, where we make use of CMIP7 forcings. These will be submitted.

## Single testing phase

### 1. Historical greenhouse gas concentrations

### 2. Historical CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

### 3. Solar forcing

### 4. Volcanic forcing

### 5. Land-use forcing

### 6. Sulphur cycle/aerosol scheme

### 7. Ozone in HadCM3 and how to include CMIP forcing

## Combined testing phase

## CMIP7 experiments phase
